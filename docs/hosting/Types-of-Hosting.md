# Different Types of Hosting

With **GrapeVine**, we put the power of hosting directly into the user's hands. Rather than locking you into a rigid deployment system, GrapeVine enables developers and creators to build, scale, and manage their own infrastructure across any cloud provider or self-hosted stack.

We provide a massive library of tooling for all types of hosting and deployment scenarios:

- Shell Scripts for quick-start environments  
- CloudFormation templates for AWS orchestration  
- Dockerfiles and Docker Compose setups  
- Kubernetes manifests (coming soon)  
- Pre-built images and provisioning templates  
- Network and DNS configuration templates  

GrapeVine's goal is to maintain an eclectic, well-tested collection of infrastructure scripts and blueprints that work across use cases — from development to production, local servers to multi-region cloud.

These scripts allow users to:

- **Create**, **scale**, and **delete** environments on-demand  
- **Switch cloud providers** without starting over  
- **Integrate with CI/CD** pipelines easily  
- **Customize stacks** using any language or platform  

GrapeVine is an **Infrastructure-as-Code powerhouse**, tightly integrated with the KiwiCLI tool. With one command, you can configure your entire cloud infrastructure, ensuring repeatability, scalability, and full control of your deployment strategy.

Whether you’re running a band website, an eCommerce portal, or a multi-user SaaS app — GrapeVine gives you the freedom to host it your way.
