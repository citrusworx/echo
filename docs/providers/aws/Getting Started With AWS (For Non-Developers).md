# Getting Started With AWS (For Non-Developers)

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is one of the most popular cloud platforms in the world. It gives you the tools to put your website, app, or project online — fast, securely, and affordably.

**Kiwi Engine works great with AWS**, and we’ve built easy-to-use templates that handle most of the hard stuff for you. Even if you’ve never used a cloud provider before, we’ll walk you through it step-by-step.

## ✅ Why Choose AWS?

- **Free to Start** — Many services have a “free tier” so you can test without being charged.
- **Global and Reliable** — Trusted by companies large and small, AWS gives your project a home on the internet that’s fast and secure.
- **Works With Kiwi** — Our tools (like GrapeVine) are made to work with AWS. That means fewer steps for you and more features out of the box.
