## 🚀 Why Kiwi Engine?

### 🧱 Modular Architecture

* Use only what you need: CMS, eCommerce, CRM, API Builder, UI Kit, and more.
* Every part of the stack is optional, composable, and extensible.

### 🌐 Bring Your Own Stack

* Frontend? Use Vanilla, React, Svelte, or your favorite framework.
* Hosting? Use your provider of choice — from local to AWS, GCP, or Hetzner.
* Database? Swap between PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or whatever your app needs.

### 🧠 Smart, Declarative Backend (Nectarine)

* Define APIs and database schemas using clean, readable YAML.
* Skip the boilerplate, keep the control.

### 💻 Visual UI Builder (Sugar)

* Drag-and-drop app builder with Node-based logic editor.
* Build powerful apps without writing code — or drop in code when you want to.

### 🧰 Developer CLI (KiwiCLI)

* One command to scaffold, deploy, inspect, or export your app.
* Perfect for rapid prototyping and production rollouts.

### ⚙️ Infrastructure-as-Code Built In (GrapeVine)

* Shell scripts, Dockerfiles, CloudFormation templates — all version-controlled.
* Includes cost breakdowns, setup guides, and one-click deploy options.

### 📦 Real Apps, Built With Kiwi

* From StrumSales (PoS system) to citrusOS (admin dashboard) to Sugar itself — every Kiwi-made app is a proof-of-concept and tutorial.
